    <h2>Details</h2>
    The New Worlds many benefits will lead to a more stable and healthy environment. You may think "hey the Old World has all of these", Yes the Old World has all of these but the amount of people there and all the machinery pollutes the air and worsens the environment. The New World has fresh air, imagine walking outside your stable home built by our construction workers and breathing in the fresh un polluted air, looking at the fresh brand new crops,sipping on some top notch alcohol what a life!
</p>
<h2>Why We Want Who We Want</h2>
<p>
    We want very specific people for very specific reasons. Hunters are wanted so we have people to kill animals and keep animal population down with the bonus of their meats as food. Fisherman are wanted for the same reason but in the water. Blacksmiths to make everyone weapons and armor incase of wars. Doctors and Nurses are wanted for the abilities to fix up any injured or sick citizens. Farmers to grow crops to help the hunters and fisherman keep everyone fed. We need Missionary's incase any countries or anyone tries to take our land. Construction workers are crucial because we need people to build housing. Lumberjacks are essential to work with the construction workers to cut down trees for lumber to build houses. We want younger workers aswell that aspire to do one of these many jobs so that we keep stable amount of age groups and younger workers means longer working as the job chosen. We only want cute females because women are essential for children to be made to keep generations going.
